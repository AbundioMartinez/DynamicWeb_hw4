Loops are great when you want to do the same task/run the same code over and over again, and each time with a different value. Give two reasons why they are great. *  They are great when working with arrays.*  Theæfor loopæloops through a block of code a specified number of times.2. What is the basic syntax for a for loop? Give the higher level (more complexly worded syntax) and the more basic syntax.for(initialization; condition; final-expression) {    statement}0rfor (step 1; step 2; step 3) {    // code block to be executed}        3. What does the for loop basically do?The ñfor loopî provides a concise way of writing the loop structure. Unlike a while loop, a for statement consumes the initialization, condition and increment/decrement in one line thereby providing a shorter, easy to debug structure of looping.4. Give an example of a for loop, and then explain what is going on with the code.for (let i=0; i<100; i++) {console.log(ïNumnber is : ${i}Í);}Statement 1 sets a variable before the loop starts (var i =0)             Statement 2 defines the condition for the loop to run (imust be less than 100)              Statement 3 increases a value (i++) each time the codeblock in the loop had been executed5. What two characters (used in code) represent the for loop code block? (aka initialization):(aka condition):The two characters used to represent the for loop code blockare curly brackets { }    6. After the for loop code block has been executed, which step does the for loop program return to?The program returns to step 2.7.Give an example of a for loop that includes an if statement and a break statement within the if statement. DonÍt give the exact example in the loops-arrays slide deck. I will not give you credit if you do. Customize it. Make it your own. I will provide links at the end of this document to other places where you can get more ideas for examples.Example: number = 0 for number in range(10): if number == 5: break print('Number is ' + str(number)) print('Out of loopÍ)for ([initialfunction myFunction() {  var text = ""  var i;  for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {    if (i === 3) {      break;    }    text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";  }  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;}let armLevel = "";for (let amrAttack = 1; amrAttack < 100; amrAttack++) { if (amrAttack > 20) {document.querySelector(".damage_cal").innerHTML = amrLevel; break; } amrLevel += `Arm has reached ${amrAttack} Attack!` + `<br>`;}document.querySelector(".damage_cal").innerHTML = amrLevel;8. Give an example of a for loop that includes an if statement and a continue statement within the if statement. DonÍt give the exact example in the loops-arrays slide deck. I will not give you credit if you do. Customize it. Style it with the help of CSS in JS (refer to the loops-arrays slide deck to follow how I do it; you can also reach out to me for help!). Make it your own. I will provide links at the end of this document to other places where you can get more ideas for examples.Example: number = 0 for number in range(10): if number == 5: continue print('Number is ' + str(number)) print('Out of loop')function myFunction() {  var text = "";  var i;  for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {    if (i === 3) {      continue;    }    text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";  }  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;}let field = "";for (toys = 1; toys < 10 ; toys++) { if (toys === 3) { continue; } field +=`${toys} toy collected! <br>`;}const toyCollected = document.querySelector(".field");toyCollected.innerHTML = field;9. Give me an example of an array. You can use whatever data type you want inside. Use the examples in the slide deck as guidelines, but make up your own.let promoteClass = ["Mage", "Thief", "cleric"]; console.log(promoteClass);       var fruits= ["Orange", "Apple", "Pear"];document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =fruits;//Orange,Apple ,Pear10. Give me another example of an array using a DIFFFERENT data type from number   You can use more than one if you like as well! Get creative. Use the examples in the slide deck as guidelines, but make up your own.let countNum = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]; console.log(countNum);let food  = ['Pizza', 'Tacos', 'Soup', 'SaladÕ]console.log(food)// ["Pizza", "Tacos", "Soup", "Salad"]11. Declare and initialize and array (remember, initializing means applying a value to the variable, in this case the value of the variable would be an array). Then create a for loop which iterates over that array. Use the loops-arrays slide deck as a guide to how to do this, and you can also visit the JavaScript For Loop page on W3Schools, The JavaScript For Statement page on WsSchools, the Loops and Iteration page on MDN, and other links provided in the helpful reading section at the end of this document.var vegetables = ['Artichoke', 'Arugula', 'Asparagus'];var x;for (x of vegetables) {  document.write(x + "<br >");}//Artichoke//Arugula//Asparaguslet loopArrayDataType = ["string", true, 0, false];let allDataType = loopArrayDataType.length;let arrayResult = "";for (i = 0; i < allDataType; i++) {arrayResult += loopArrayDataType[i] + "<br>";}let loopArrayShow = document.querySelector(".data_type");loopArrayShow.innerHTML = arrayResult;12. Give an example of a for in loop. Explain what is going on with the code. Use the loops-arrays slide deck as an inspiration and/or guide to creating your for-in loop, the related resources I have included at the end of the slide deck there, along with the other links I have provided in the Helpful Reading section at the end of this document. but make it your own! Get creative. Again, somehow involve CSS in JS in a similar way to the way you did it for number 8.function myFunction() {  var person = {fname:"Abundio ", lname:"Morales ", age:80 };   function myFuntion(){  var text = "";  //var x;  for (const x in person) {    text += person[x] + " ";  }  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;}//Abundio Morales 80myfunction();13. Give an example of a for of loop. Explain what is going on with the code. Use the loops-arrays slide deck as an inspiration and/or guide to creating your for-in loop, the related resources I have included at the end of the slide deck there, along with the other links I have provided in the Helpful Reading section at the end of this document.const sodaFlavor = ["Sprite", "Orange", "Coke", "Vanilla"]; for (const sodaFlavorValue of sodaFlavor) { console.log(sodaFlavorValue); } For of loop can go to through the values of an iterable object. Right now I am using looping  ÒcardTypeÕ with a for of loop to get the array values.14. Tell me what is the (main) difference between a for in loop and a for of loop.The main difference a for in loop and for of loop is that ñfor inîis a method for iterating over enumerable properties of anobject, which is any property that you add to an object.The main difference is that for of can only loop through iterable objects.15. Give me an example of a do while loop. Use the loops-arrays slide deck as an inspiration and/or guide to creating your for-in loop, the related resources I have included at the end of the slide deck there, along with the other links I have provided in the Helpful Reading section at the end of this document.do { i_var = i_var + 1; doResult = doResult + i_var; } while (i_var < 5); console.log(doResult);var text = ""var i = 0;do {  text += "<br>The number is " + i;  i++;}while (i <6);  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;//The number is 0//The number is 1//The number is 2//The number is 3//The number is 4//The number is 516. Why does a loop (in general) terminate?It terminates because a break statement is used, which stops the execution of a loop entirely and the conditions that was stated are no longer true.A loop terminates because the condition is no longer true.Description: do while statement creates a loop that continues to execute until the condition presented is NO LONGER TRUE.
